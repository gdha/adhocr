== NAME
adhocr - Ad-hoc Copy and Run

== SYNOPSIS
*adhocr* [*-k*] [*-p* _#threads_] [*-u* _username_][ _ARGS_...] _COMMAND_ 


== DESCRIPTION
Adhocr is a tool which allows you to execute, on multiple systems simultanously, commands and collect the output in a central way. It can also execute commands on remote systems as root with sudo (this requires your password and you being granted to run sudo in the first place). Adhocr makes use of Secure Shell and expect.

-l <logdir>::

        [optional - default ~/logs]

-o <outputdir>::
        Directory to store output
        [optional - default ~/output]

-sudo::
        Force remote commands to be executed via sudo
        [optional - default NO]

-x|-expect::
        Use SSH with expect to login remotely (e.g. no SSH keys were exchanged)
        [optional - default *YES*]

-npw|-nx|-bg::
        Use only SSH (without expect) to execute remote commands
        [optional - default NO]

-t <seconds>::
        timeout in seconds [optional - default 900]

-h::

-up::
        Upload documents with SCP (using expect [-x] or without expect [-nx])
        [optional - default NO]

-dl::
        Download documents with SCP (default with expect, use -nx to use scp only)


-c "command (; commands)"::
        Commands to execute on remote system(s), e.g. "uname -r" [*required*]
	+
        Note 1: upload file (-up) commands are "local-file remote-file"
	+
        Note 2: download file (-dl) commands are "remote-file local-file"

== EXAMPLES

`adhocr -p 20 -f systems/my-hosts -t 30 -c "uname -r"`::
	Run adhocr on all systems listed in the file _systems/my-hosts_ with a maximum of 20 parallel threads
	and use a time-out of 30 seconds (to kill hanging processes if any). Adhocr will use by default expect
	and will ask for your (Active Directory) password. The remote command _uname -r_ will not be executed
	with sudo (is by default off).

`adhocr -f systems/hpux-hosts -t 20 -sudo -c "[[ -x /usr/sbin/cmviewcl ]] && /usr/sbin/cmviewcl"`::
	Use adhocr to query your HP-UX systems, using expect and sudo to root, about the Serviveguard cluster
	overview (if any). Your password will be asked (as _sudo_ implies this).

`adhocr -u wendy -t 30 -p 30 -f systems/Dev-Systems -c "xpinfo -v"`::
	Run adhocr as user _wendy_ and by default prompt for a password. The _-p_ option allows to start
	maximum 30 sessions in parallel.
